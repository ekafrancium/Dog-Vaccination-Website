# Dog-Vaccination-Website
n the dog vaccination website project, my role was to lead the development and design of a user-friendly website that provided essential information about dog vaccinations, schedules, and locations. I collaborated with my team to create a visually appealing and informative platform. The outcomes obtained included increased accessibility to vaccination information for dog owners, improved awareness about the importance of vaccinations, and higher vaccination rates as a result.
